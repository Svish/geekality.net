Ever wanted to, for some reason, clone a database table? Don't really want to export anything or figure out what statement was used to create that table? Turns out that's a lot easier to do than I thought it was.

Stumbled over a blog post on how you can copy a MySQL table with schema and keys, and boy was it easy.

```sql
CREATE TABLE newtable LIKE oldtable;
```

And that's it! Want the data copied over as well?

```sql
INSERT INTO newtable SELECT * FROM oldtable;
```

Super easy! ðŸ™ƒ
