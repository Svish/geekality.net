Just discovered a way to find what's keeping my Windows computer awake or my screen from going black.

1. Open up an [elevated command prompt](/?p=1139).
2. Run the following command

```dos
> powercfg -requests
```

While playing a video in Windows Media Player I get this output:

```text
DISPLAY:
[PROCESS] \Device\HarddiskVolume2\Program Files (x86)\Windows Media Player\wmplayer.exe

SYSTEM:
[DRIVER] High Definition Audio Device (HDAUDIO\FUNC_01&VEN_10EC&DEV_0888&SUBSYS_1458A102&REV_1000\4&1454c4ac&0&0001)
An audio stream is currently in use.
[PROCESS] \Device\HarddiskVolume2\Program Files (x86)\Windows Media Player\wmplayer.exe

AWAYMODE:
None.

EXECUTION:
None.

PERFBOOST:
None.
```

Simple and clear!
