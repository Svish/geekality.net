Alright, we are doing this again. After having watched a very inspiring session with [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/) called _Making Your Blog Suck Less: Social Networking and Your Personal Brand Online_ at the Norwegian Developer Conference 2009, I figured I should have a go at this thing again. I have had various websites before and a couple of blogs, however they all suffered from me wanting to program more than I wanted to write. That means I usually ended up programming my own stuff, having loads of fun designing, putting things together, forcing some text about myself and what I do out there, and then... well, then they pretty much died.

So, now I am going for WordPress and is hoping that I will manage to stick with it for a while. And hopefully get some stuff out here too. Will try out Scott's advice on using drafts in Live Writer, etc.

Aaaaanyways, have a look around, drop me an email if you want, comment on stuff, subscribe to my feed, et cetera. Or just ignore me. That is fine by me too ðŸ˜›

_By the way_ if you are interested in seeing that very good session, you can find them [here](https://www.alsagile.com/archive/2009/08/31/ndc-2009-videos.aspx). I recommend downloading it using the BitTorrent file you find there. If you think it is a bit much, just use a decent BitTorrent client like [ÂµTorrent](https://www.utorrent.com/) and you can select just that file. However I really do recommend that you download the whole thing cause it is a lot of really great stuff there. For example some very good introduction sections to Test-Driven Development with [Roy Osherove](https://weblogs.asp.net/ROsherove).
