> Panic attacks are episodes of feeling extremely frightened together with having a number of physical symptoms related to fear – such as shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, feeling your heart pounding, butterflies in the stomach, sweating, feeling weak-kneed, tingling in hands and feet, dizziness, feeling that you are likely to faint, go crazy or die and feeling that you or your surroundings are not quite real.
