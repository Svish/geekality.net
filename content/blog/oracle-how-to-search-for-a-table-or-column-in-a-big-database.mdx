I needed to find columns containing a certain string. That is, the name of the column should contain that string. Actually not too difficult to do ðŸ™‚

```sql
SELECT owner, table_name, column_name
FROM all_tab_columns
WHERE column_name LIKE '%FOO_ID%';
```

That gives you a nice list of all columns containing `FOO_ID` and what tables you find them in. Fantastic! Now, back to work...
