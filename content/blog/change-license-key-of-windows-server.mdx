Needed to install two Windows Server 2012 R2 instances today, but didn't have a valid production license key yet and didn't seem like there was a way to skip the key in the setup. Found you can [remove a license key using a command](http://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/27819-change-windows-server-2012-product-key), so worked around it using a temporary dev key from MSDN for the installation and then removed that key afterwards. For future self-reference, here's how...

1. Open an [elevated command prompt](/?p=1139)
1. To remove key run `slmgr -upk`
1. To add new one run `slmgr -ipk NEW-KEY` _or_ use regular activation process
