Since I keep forgetting and sometimes meet horrible, horrible colors when opening vim on various servers...

```text
:colo TAB
```

And by that I mean, inside vim, type `:colo ` (shorthand for colorscheme) and then press <kbd>TAB</kbd> to cycle through built-in color schemes. Press <kbd>‚èé</kbd> to activate.

To make it permanent, put the the command in your `~/.vimrc`, without the initial colon.

```text
colo foobar
```
