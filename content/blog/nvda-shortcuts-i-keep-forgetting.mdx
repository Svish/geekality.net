Testing your web projects with a screen reader is quite important and informative, but can also be quite annoying while jumping back and forth between developing and testing. Here are some shortcuts I keep forgetting to make NVDA a bit less annoying during development:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">
      <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
    </th>
    <td>Stops current reading</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">
      <kbd>Ins</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>
    </th>
    <td>
      Switches between off-, sound-, and speech-mode (while stuff keeps being
      listed in log and braille view
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">
      <kbd>Ins</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd>
    </th>
    <td>Quite NVDA</td>
  </tr>
</table>
