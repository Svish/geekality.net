Just a small registry script that makes status messages during startup and shutdown procedures in Windows 7 (and possibly Vista?) more interesting.

Create a simple text file with the following text in it:

```text
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System]
"VerboseStatus"=dword:00000001
```

Give the file a name with the `reg` extension, for example `VerboseStatus.reg` and run it. Double-clicking it should do the trick. After it has done it's job you should see some more interesting messages during startup and shutdown procedures ðŸ™‚

To turn it off again, just switch the 1 to a 0 in that reg file and run it again. Should do the trick... Not sure if I have tested that as I always have it on.

<Note>
  âš  You do this on your own responsibility, so if you manage to mess up your
  computer, don't blame me ðŸ˜› I run this reg file after every fresh install of
  Windows 7 though, so as long as you don't do anything weird, it should work
  fine.
