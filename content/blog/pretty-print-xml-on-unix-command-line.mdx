Needed to check some XML output from a CalDAV service so I used curl, which is nice and simple. Only problem was that all the XML came back on a single long unreadable line. Turned out it wasn't too difficult to get it formatted:

```bash
$ curl --digest --user usr:pwd -X PROPFIND | xmllint --format -
```

The key part here is of course the piping into `xmllint`. `--format` tells it to format the XML and the `-` tells it to read the XML from standard in. The dash can be swapped with the path to an XML file, if you need to format already downloaded XML.

```bash
$ xmllint --format file.xml
```
