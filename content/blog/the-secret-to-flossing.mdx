I have cracked the code! For years I have been telling my dentist lies about me
going to start flossing. Of course I never did. Tried it a couple of times, but
that's about it. Not because I didn't want to. I just couldn't really figure it
out. First of all how to actually do it, and second how to get it into the
system. I mean, you brush your teeth, and then... who really wants to do
anything more after that other than maybe rinsing your teeth with some good and
mild fluoride mouth wash? Not me at least. But I finally figured it out. Thanks
to a blog post I no longer remember where was.

## The secret

_Always_ floss _first_. _Then_ brush your teeth.

It's that simple. Who knew?! Probably everyone but me! And now you know too, even if you maybe already did. And if you already did, good for you! Either way, go get some good dental floss, start flossing, and stop lying to your dentist!

Again, to really knock it in and make this post unnecessarily long:

1. Floss
1. Brush
1. Rinse
