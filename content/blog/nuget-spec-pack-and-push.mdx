Keep forgetting these lines, so sticking them here for future reference.

## Spec

```powershell
nuget spec SomeProject.csproj
```

Fix up created nuspec file afterwards.

## Pack and Publish

```powershell
nuget pack SomeProject.csproj -Build -Symbols -Properties Configuration=Release
nuget push [main nupkg file created by previous command]
```

This will pack and push to both the public [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) feed and to [SymbolSource](http://www.symbolsource.org/Public).
