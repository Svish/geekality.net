I've always kind of thought of myself as a geek, or a nerd, or something in that genre. But I have never really understood the subtle differences between them. Recently I came over a good Venn diagram that explains it all! So from now on, this is the definition I will go by ðŸ˜›

Yes, that diagram is also what my site title and tagline is based upon ðŸ˜‰
