A few times I've needed to download a full website. Some examples have been to download a full website for offline browsing, or to make a full static HTML backup/archive.

`wget` usually comes built-in with unix systems, but itâ€™s [available for Windows as well](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/).

```bash
wget --timeout 5 --tries 0 --mirror --no-parent --wait 5 --random-wait --adjust-extension --convert-links --page-requisites --directory-prefix=output/dir http://example.com
```
