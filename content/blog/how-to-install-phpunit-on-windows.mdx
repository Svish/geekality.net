Note to self in case I need to do this again...

Commands assumes the PHP install is in `C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.13` and that this path is already added to the PATH environment variable.

## Install PEAR

1. Download [`go-pear.phar`](http://pear.php.net/go-pear.phar) and Save it as `C:\wamp\bin\php\php5.3.13\pear\go-pear.phar`.
2. Open an elevated command prompt.
3. Go to the PHP directory.

```dos
cd \wamp\bin\php\php5.3.13
```

4. Install PEAR, pressing enter to accept defaults and Y to alter php.ini.

```dos
php .\pear\go-pear.phar
```

5. Add environment variables.

```dos
start PEAR_ENV.reg
```

## Install PhpUnit

1. Make sure pear is fully up to date (should be if we just installed it)

```dos
pear upgrade-all
```

2. Add pear channels.

```dos
pear channel-discover components.ez.no
pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
pear channel-discover pear.symfony.com
```

3. Install PHPUnit with all dependencies.

```dos
pear install --alldeps phpunit/PHPUnit
```

4. Verify installation by checking version.

```dos
phpunit --version
```
