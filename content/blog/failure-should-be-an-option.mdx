Just wanted to share [a blog post](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/04/the-flip-side.html) I stumbled over on [Seth's blog](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/). Since it was very short and very good (and I don't want to lose it), I'll just quote the whole thing here.

Good point and well said! Definitely something to think about. I'd say this applies both in software development and life in general. And probably in a lot of other areas you might think of ðŸ™‚
