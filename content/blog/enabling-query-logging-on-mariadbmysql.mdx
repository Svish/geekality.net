When developing it can sometimes be very useful to see exactly what queries are sent to the database.

Found out there's something called a [General Query Log](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/general-query-log/), and enabling it was really easy. Just add the following to your <b>my.\{ini,cnf\}</b> file:

```ini
[mysqld]
general-log=1
general-log-file=queries.log
log-output=file
```

Restart the server and you should now find the log in your data directory (unless no queries done yet).

If you don't know where your data directory is, just run this query:

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES WHERE variable_name = 'datadir'
```
