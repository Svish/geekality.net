Using `nslookup` with the default DNS server:

```dos
> nslookup example.com
Server:  one.one.one.one
Address:  1.1.1.1

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    example.com
Addresses:  2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946
          93.184.216.34
```

Using `nslookup` with a specific one, in this case Google's DNS server with IP `8.8.8.8`:

```dos
> nslookup example.com 8.8.8.8
Server:  dns.google
Address:  8.8.8.8

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    example.com
Addresses:  2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946
          93.184.216.34
```

## Reverse

Using `nslookup`:

```dos
> nslookup 8.8.8.8
Server:  one.one.one.one
Address:  1.1.1.1

Name:    dns.google
Address:  8.8.8.8
```

Using `ping`:

```dos
> ping -n 1 -a 8.8.8.8

Pinging dns.google [8.8.8.8] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=10ms TTL=60

Ping statistics for 8.8.8.8:
    Packets: Sent = 1, Received = 1, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 10ms, Maximum = 10ms, Average = 10ms
```

<Note>
  Reverse lookup doesn't always work; seems to depend on DNS records being setup
  properly. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
