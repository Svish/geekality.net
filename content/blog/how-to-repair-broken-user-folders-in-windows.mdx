Tried moving my Documents/Desktop/Music/etc folders to a <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/download/">Google Drive</a> mounted via <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/7491144">Drive File Stream</a>. Seemed to work well at first, but after the first reboot Windows clearly wasn't happy and kept complaining about not finding the Desktop or the Documents...

Possibly because that drive seems to be mounted a bit too slowly (i.e. happens a bit after one has logged in)? And/or because it's just mounted in a way Windows doesn't like?

Either way, here's how to...

## Fix

1. Open up <b>`regedit`</b>
1. Go to: `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders`
1. Update all incorrect values
1. Reboot

That seems to have fixed it for me anyways...
