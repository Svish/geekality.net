Say you have a bunch of files and you want to quickly change or remove the file extension of all of them. Turns out that's very simple to do with the command-line in Windows. I had no idea...

## Change

```dos
ren *.old *.new
```

Will change all files with <var>old</var> file extension to have the <var>new</var> file extension.

## Remove

```dos
ren *.old *.
```

Will remove the <var>old</var> file extension.

Simple!
