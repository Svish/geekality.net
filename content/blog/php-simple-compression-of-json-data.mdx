Just discovered how super simple it was to add some gz compression when for example [providing JSON data](/?p=1021 'How to easily provide JSON and JSONP') from PHP.

All you need is regular output buffering with the [`ob_gzhandler`](http://php.net/manual/en/function.ob-gzhandler.php) as output callback.

```php
// Fetch some data
$data = get_data();

// Turn on output buffering with the gzhandler
ob_start('ob_gzhandler');

// Output as normal
echo json_encode($data);
```

The cool thing is that it actually looks at what the browser accepts before doing anything.

> Before `ob_gzhandler()` actually sends compressed data, it determines what type
> of content encoding the browser will accept ("gzip", "deflate" or none at all)
> and will return its output accordingly. All browsers are supported since it's
> up to the browser to send the correct header saying that it accepts compressed
> web pages.

Tried adding it for a text field with timezone auto-completing for example, and without this handler:

```text
Content-Length:    5517
Content-Type:      application/json
```

With this handler:

```text
Content-Encoding:  gzip
Vary:              Accept-Encoding
Content-Length:    1775
Content-Type:      application/json
```

Do like! ðŸ˜Š
