Have a really horrible internet connection currently, and whenever Windows Update and OneDrive starts downloading stuff, I can basically not do anything else because they're hogging <em>all</em> my bandwidth.

## BITS

1. Open <i>Local Group Policy Editor</i>.
1. Go to <i>Computer Configuration / Administrative Templates / Network / Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)</i>.
1. Enable <i>Limit the maximum network bandwidth for BITS background transfers</i>, and optionally adjust the rate and hours.
1. Reboot, possibly?

## QoS Policy

1. Open <i>Local Group Policy Editor</i>.
1. Go to <i>User Configuration / Windows Settings / Policy-based QoS</i>.
1. Right-click and hit <i>Create new policy</i>.
1. Set <i>DSCP Value</i> to <i>1</i> and/or <i>Outbound Throttle Rate</i> to something appropriate.
1. Set QoS policy to apply to applications with executable name <i>onedrive.exe</i> (or <i>skydrive.exe</i>, check your process list).
1. Reboot, possibly?
