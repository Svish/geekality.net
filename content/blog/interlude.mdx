Not much is happening at the moment. Well, actually quite a bit is happening. It's
just that I find myself in a rather non-eventful interlude of some sort.{' '}

Last Friday (January, 29th) I had my last day at <a href="http://www.smsdev.no/">SMS Development & Support AS</a> where I have been working for the last 1.5 years. It was my very first job as a full-time software developer and I learned _a lot_. Both about developing software and about myself as a developer. Good stuff!

Next up I will return to <a href="http://lifestyletv.se/home/">LifeStyleTV</a> where I spent a year as a <a href="http://mediamissionary.se/">Media Missionary</a>. This time I will be working there as a regular employee and help out with various things. Mainly I will be developing some internal software systems with some of the others there, but I will most likely also help out with the TV production. I am going down there the 11th of February and I am looking forward to get started. üôÇ

What am I doing now, during this interlude? Not a lot. Very little. Extremely little. My computer is dead. I'm sick. My energy reserves are non-existent. I'm sleeping, eating, watching tv, reading... and that's pretty much it... To be honest I am actually kind of happy I am sick now instead of earlier or later. Just hope I will be back to normal before Thursday... üòê
