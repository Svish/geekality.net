For debugging it's often useful to do `console.log(someObjectOrArray)`. However, if the array is long or the object deep, a lot will be truncated. Apparently there's a util one can use to get a bit more control over this though:

```js
import util from 'util'

console.log(
  util.inspect(someObjectOrArray, {
    colors: true,
    depth: 3,
    compact: false,
  })
)
```
