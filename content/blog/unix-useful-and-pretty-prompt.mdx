Some servers at work has varying degrees of useful prompts when I connect to them through SSH. Usually they are quite annoying and for example showing the shell type and version, which I frankly don't care much about. Here's how to make it show the current user, hostname and working directory. In addition the hostname is made more visible, which is a nice effect.

```bash
$ bold=$(tput bold)
$ reset=$(tput sgr0)
$ export PS1="\u@\[$bold\]\h\[$reset\]:\w\$ "
```

Stick it in your `.profile`, `.bash_profile` or whatever else you've got going on to make it more permanent.
