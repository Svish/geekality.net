Needed to see if I had lined some stuff up correctly on a website I'm making. Came up with this simple CSS to add two guides to the page that I can move around with the browser developer console (just nudge their position around to where I need them).

There's useful browser extensions around, but didn't have one, and just came up with this super simple workaround instead for now...

```css
html::after {
  content: '';
  height: 1px;
  width: 100%;
  background: red;
  position: fixed;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 5px; /* Change this to move the guide horizontally */
}
html::before {
  content: '';
  height: 100%;
  width: 1px;
  background: red;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  right: 5px; /* Change this to move the guide vertically */
}
```
