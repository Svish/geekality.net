Just a note to self on how to fully clean a git working directory.

I have some tricky projects where I'm currently located, and sometimes things get messed up and IntelliJ doesn't know what to do with them anymore...

The following will clear _everything_ out, and allow for a clean re-import:

```dos
git clean -f -x -d
```

<dl>
  <dt>`-f`</dt>
  <dd>Force</dd>
  <dt>`-x`</dt>
  <dd>Also remove ignored files</dd>
  <dt>`-d`</dt>
  <dd>Also remove directories</dd>
</dl>
