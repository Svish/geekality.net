In Unix you have the `touch` command which you can use to update a files timestamp. No such thing in Windows. But instead, apparently, one can do this:

```dos
REM Updates the timestamp of the file
copy /b filename.ext +,,

REM Creates a new empty file
echo $null >> filename.ext
```

If you need it more than seldom there are also some more tricks in the StackOverflow sources below.
