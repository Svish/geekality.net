There's a command-line tool called <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil">certutil</a> one can use to add (among other things) certificates to the certificate store in windows.

Some examples:

```dos
REM Add pfx-file to Personal
certutil -ent -p pfxpassword -importpfx my some.pfx

REM Add pfx-file to Trusted Root Certification Authorities
certutil -ent -p pfxpassword -importpfx root some.pfx

REM Add cer-file to Trusted Root Certification Authorities
certutil -ent -addstore root some.cer
```
