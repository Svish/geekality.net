Logged into a windows share via explorer and hit the Remember Password option. Even though the login was accepted (and saved) it turned out I had used the wrong ad domain name...

Couldn't find where to reset/change/"logout" again, but eventually found there's a built-in command-line tool one can use for managing these saved passwords. Think I've seen a control panel type thing to do this too in the past, but just couldn't find it today...

Anyways, command-line is nice, so, using imaginary share `\\foobar.int`, here's some stuff one can do:

```dos
cmdkey /list
cmdkey /list:foobar.int

cmdkey /delete:foobar.int

cmdkey /add:foobar.int /user:domain\username /pass
```
