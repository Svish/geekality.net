Made an export from [Splunk](http://www.splunk.com) containing all IP addresses who had called a method on a companies ESB servers. This gave me a large CSV with two columns, Method and IP, which I then needed to filter to remove duplicate rows. Additionally I wanted to try a reverse lookup of the address to identify what system in our environment was actually doing the call us.

```powershell
Import-Csv .\requests.csv |
sort Method,IP -Unique |
select *,@{Name="Host";Expression={[Net.Dns]::GetHostEntry($_.IP).HostName}}
Export-Csv .\requests-filtered.csv
```

Most lines should be self-explanatory, but the neat bit is the select statement. I use the `*` to select all existing properties, and then I use a nutty syntax I learned today to add a calculated property.

Pretty neat. Worked great, with the exception that every IP was resolvable, but's the fault of the DNS server at the company... ðŸ™‚
