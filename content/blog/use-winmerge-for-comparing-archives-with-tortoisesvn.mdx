I really like the Diff Viewer that comes with TortoiseSVN, but from what I can gather it doesn't seem to support anything but text files, which is fair enough, but I need to compare archives as well. Zip and Jar files in particular.

WinMerge supports that, and _can_ be integrated with TortoiseSVN very easily right through its installer. But I prefer the diff viewer that comes with TortoiseSVN and the archive diff isn't recursive by default, so I decided to set it up manually.

1. Install [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/)
   - Deselect <i>Automagic TortoiseSVN integration</i>
2. Install the [WinMerge 7-zip plugin](http://winmerge.org/downloads/plugins.php)
   - Select <i>Application specific installation</i>
   - Browse to WinMerge executable
   - Enable <i>Enable standalone operation</i>
3. Open <i>WinMerge</i> and go to <i>Edit, Options, Archive Support</i>
   - Enable <i>Detect archive type from file signature</i>
   - Switch to <i>Use local 7-Zip from WinMerge folder</i>
4. Open <i>TortoiseSVN Settings</i> and go to <i>Diff Viewer, Advanced</i>
   - Add rows with extension set to .zip, .jar and whatever archives you want WinMerge to handle and set external program to the following:

```dos
C:\Program Files (x86)\WinMerge\WinMergeU.exe /r /x /e /u /dl %bname /dr %yname %base %mine
```

If I now for example ask TortoiseSVN for a <i>Diff with previous version</i> of a jar file, I get WinMerge with a recursive comparison of the archive contents.

<Note>
  ðŸ’¡ When you're diffing archives in WinMerge, deselecting _Show Identical
  Items_ under _View_ makes actual differences much easier to see.
