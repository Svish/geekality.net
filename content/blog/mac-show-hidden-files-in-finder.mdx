If you want to make hidden files show up in Finder, you can open up a Terminal window and run these two commands:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
killall Finder && open /System/Library/CoreServices/Finder.app
```

Swap `TRUE` with `FALSE` to hide them again. The second line kills and relaunches Finder.
