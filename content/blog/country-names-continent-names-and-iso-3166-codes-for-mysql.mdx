Needed a MySQL table containing continent names, country names and their ISO-3166
codes while ago, but the ones I found were either kind of lacking or kind of old. So, I made one myself by converting a [datafile on Wikipedia](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_soveriegn_states_and_dependent_territories_by_continent_(data_file)>) into the format I wanted with some regular expressions and manual corrections

Aftwarwards I went through newsletters with [Updates on ISO 3166](http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/updates_on_iso_3166.htm), hopefully I got it all right, and hopefully it can save you and others some time as well.

I have also subscribed to their updates and try to follow up when they change anything.

## The data

Created a [project on GitHub](https://github.com/Svish/iso-3166-country-codes/) for some change tracking. The latest version of the SQL script is found at [github.com/Svish/iso-3166-country-codes/blob/master/countries.sql](https://github.com/Svish/iso-3166-country-codes/blob/master/countries.sql). If you find any mistakes or updates I've missed, please create a PR or an issue on that project. ðŸ™ƒ
