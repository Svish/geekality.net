Keep forgetting how to...

1. Use e.g. [PuTTYgen](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen) to generate a key.

<Note>
  ðŸ’¡ Fill out "Key comment" unless you want a rather messy, uninformative
  `authorized_keys` file...
</Note>

2. Add public key on server:

```bash
mkdir -pm 700 ~/.ssh
vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Should then work as long as the private key is then added to Pageant, WinSCP config, etc, etc.
