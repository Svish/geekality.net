These are some assorted notes I took during a sermon held by <a href="http://haraldsblogg.blogspot.com/">Harald Giesebrecht</a> in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/adventistkirkencornelius/">Cornelius</a> some time ago. One of the better and more useful sermons I've heard in quite a while.

## What it is not

- It's not for anyone, just the one that was hurt. The one who was hurt can
  forgive the one who hurt them; no more, no less. You cannot forgive a person
  what they've done towards someone else.
- It's not to say "It's no big deal".
- It's not to forget.
- It's not to suddenly trust someone again. Trust is something which has to be
  earned over time.
- It's not limited to those who regret. You <em>can</em> forgive someone, even
  if they don't regret what they did to you.
- It's not that it doesn't hurt anymore.
- It's not something which has to be done fast. To be able to forgive might
  take time.

## What it is

- It's a gift you can give by grace.
- It's to relinquish the right to "tug at someones consciousness".
- It's to stop bringing it up over and over again.
- It's to let go so <em>you</em> can move on.

## Why do it

- Not because the one who did it deserves it.
- Forgiveness, rightly understood, will be healing to you.

## Some parabels

- Debt: Forgiveness is like erasing debt.
- Pitfall: Say someone fell into a pitfall. Forgiveness is like letting the
  one who hurt you out, rather than tormenting them.
- Chain: Imagine that you chain yourself to someone, and only you have the key
  to unlock it. Forgiveness is like choosing to unlock and remove the chain,
  rather than pulling on it to hurt the one who hurt you. Often times you're
  actually the only one who feel the tug as well. Maybe they didn't know they
  hurt you, maybe they've managed to move on, or maybe they've died.

## Some quotes

> To be bitter is like drinking poison and hoping the other person will die.

> To be resentful is like letting someone move in to your head and live there
> for free.
