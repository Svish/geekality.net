When connecting my headphones via a simple USB-plug, the audio levels are often way, way, too loud. Today I had to turn the volume all the way down to 2% for the audio just to be OK'ish. That's not very usable, and also kind of scary...

_Finally_ found something to fix it!

1. Install [Equalizer APO](https://sourceforge.net/p/equalizerapo/)
2. Open up "C:\Program Files\EqualizerAPO\config\config.txt"
3. Replace its contents with:<br/>

```text
Preamp: -30 dB
```

4. And adjust that level as necessary...

Now I can finally use the volume bar in Windows, and the volume media keys on my keyboard properly. And no longer do I need to be afraid of suddenly having my eardrums shattered if the audio were to move a percentage or two... or, even worse, reset to max...
