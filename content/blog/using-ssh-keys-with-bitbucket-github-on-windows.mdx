Couldn't get this to work, but now it does, so... time for another "note to self". ðŸ™‚

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), obviously...
- [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org), with `puttygen`, `plink` and `pageant`, to be exact...

## Setup

1. Open <b>`puttygen`</b>.
2. Either <b>Load</b> an existing private key, or <b>Generate</b> a new one.
3. Copy the <b>public key</b> ("Public key for pasting ...") and add it to the git provider settings:
   - https://<b>github.com</b>/settings/keys
   - https://<b>bitbucket.org</b>/account/user/[username]/ssh-keys/
   - https://<b>dev.azure.com</b>/[organization]/\_usersSettings/keys
4. Open <b>`pageant`</b>.
5. Load your <b>private key</b>.
6. Check that the key authentication works with <b>`plink`</b>:

```dos
plink -v git@github.com
plink -v git@bitbucket.org
plink -v git@ssh.dev.azure.com
```

7. Set the <b>`GIT_SSH`</b> environment variable to `C:\Program Files\PuTTY\plink.exe`  
   â¬† This is the detail that _so_ many StackOverflow answers and blog/forum
   posts _didn't_ mention. Without this, <var>plink</var> worked fine,
   but <var>git</var> commands still failed with authentication errors.
8. (optional) Add a shortcut to the private key file to your startup folder.
   This way `pageant` will be automatically started, with your key,
   ready to go, whenever Windows boots up.

```dos
start shell:startup
```

## Usage

_Now_, as long as `pageant` is running _with_ your
private key loaded, it should work to clone, pull, push, etc., both to and from,
both private and public git repositories. E.g. like this:

```dos
git clone git@github.com:example/some-private-repo.git
```

If you're asked to accept/store/cache a key, but pressing `y` doesn't
work, connect using `putty` first, which should give you a dialog with the same question
which _does_ work. Putty will complain/crash because there's not actually
an ssh shell to connect to, but that's fine. After the key has been saved by putty,
git should work fine. E.g. like this:

```dos
putty -ssh git@github.com
```
