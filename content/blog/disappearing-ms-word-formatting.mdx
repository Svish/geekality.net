Got called up by a good friend today. She needed to gather the contents from various Word documents she had written during the year for her studies, into a single document to hand in at the end of the year.

The problem was that Word, for some weird reason, wouldn't copy any of the formatting. No bold, no italic, tables were a mess...

Did a quick google and gotta say, this is one of the more random things I've seen in a while. [The solution](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/officesetupdeploy/thread/8357d656-aae0-41d5-a01e-ea11087812a6) was to uninstall an application she had installed, called [Skype Click to Call](http://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/click-to-call/). Once we had uninstalled that application, the copy and paste functionality of Word was back to normal. Formatting was copied without problems.
