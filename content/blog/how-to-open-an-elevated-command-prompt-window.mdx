This is just a little step-by-step guide for how you can open up an open an elevated Command Prompt under Windows 7 (and Windows Vista I think). That is, a Command Prompt with Administrator privileges which allows you to do more stuff than you usually can.

## Slow way

1. Open your <b>Start Menu</b>
1. Go to <b>All Programs</b>
1. Go to <b>Accessories</b>
1. Right-click <b>Command Prompt</b>
1. Select <b>Run as administrator</b>
1. Answer <b>Yes</b> to the following User Account Control question

## Fast way

1. Open your <b>Start Menu</b>, or press <b><kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd></b>
1. Type <b>cmd</b> in the search field, and you should have an item called <b>cmd.exe</b> or <b>Command Prompt</b> selected
1. Press <b><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd></b>
1. Answer <b>Yes</b> to the following User Account Control question

## Even faster way for Windows 8 and up

1. Press <b><kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd></b>
1. Choose <b>Command Prompt (Admin)</b>

After following either of those, you should now have an elevated Command Prompt window
running in front of you.
