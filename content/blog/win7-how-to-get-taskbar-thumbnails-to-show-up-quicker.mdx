Do you love the taskbar thumbnails in Windows 7, but think they show up a bit too slow? I did, so I did some research and found a way to change the delay.

It requires a change in your registry, which you can do by creating a file with the following text:

```text
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Mouse]
"MouseHoverTime"="0"
```

Save it as for example `MouseHoverTime.reg`, and then run it by double-clicking on it.

If you want other hover times I think you can just change the number 0 to something else. I think the number is the amount of milliseconds between you hover over it and the thumbnail pops up.

📝 **Note:** As usual, you do stuff like this on your own
responsibility. If you break things, don't blame me 😉
