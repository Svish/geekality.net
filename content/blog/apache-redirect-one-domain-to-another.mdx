The following `.htaccess` redirects all traffic to a different domain and preserves the path.

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule (.*) https://example.com/$1 [R=301,L]
```

The following redirects non-www to www version, also preserving the path.

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^example\.com
RewriteRule (.*) https://www.example.com/$1 [R=301,L]
```

And hopefully I'll remember I put this here the next time I've forgotten how to do this...
