I'm the only one who use my computer and it's in my room and I don't really care about locking it or anything like that. I just find it annoying that I have to type a password everytime I boot it up or it comes back from sleep or screen saver mode.

I usually do this whenever I reinstall Windows. At least on my desktop computer. My laptops usually have password protection enabled. Anyways, I don't reinstall that often so I always forget how to do it. Even though it's very simple... Decided to share the procedure here, so I know where to find it ðŸ™‚

1. Press <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to open up your Run dialog
1. Type in `control userpasswords2` and hit enter
1. Under the Users tab, uncheck the checkbox that says "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer"
1. Click the Ok button
1. Enter your current password, and you're done

The next time you reboot it should go straight into Windows instead of stopping at the Welcome screen, waiting for you to type your password.
