When my wireless QC30 headset connects to a device, it reads out "connected to [device-name]". This is handy, but when for example connecting to my work laptop, which has a rather long cryptic alphanumeric name, it gets annoying instead. And since it's a work laptop, I can't just change the name of the device either, and frankly, I don't want to have to do that either. I just want my device to have a different name _specific to bluetooth_. Turns out, you can actually do that:

1. Run <b>`devmgmt.msc`</b>
1. Find your bluetooth adapter under <b>Device Manager</b> / <b>Bluetooth</b>  
   E.g. mine is called `Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R)`
1. Right-click and choose <b>Properties</b>
1. Go to the <b>Advanced</b> tab
1. Change <b>Name</b>
1. Hit <b>OK</b>

And it's done. üëç
