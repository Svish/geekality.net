Sending a basic email message in a C# application is quite easy thanks to a class called [SmptClient](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.mail.smtpclient.aspx). We simply need an address to send to, an address to send from, the message we want to send and the address of an SMTP server, hand it all to the SMTP client, and you're done:

```csharp
var from = new MailAddress("me@example.com", "Me");
var to = new MailAddress("you@example.com", "You");

var message = new MailMessage(from, to)
{
    Subject = "Greetings!",
    Body = "How are you doing today?",
};

var client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com");

using (client)
{
    try
    {
        client.Send(message);
    }
    catch (SmtpException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
    }
}
```

That was pretty simple, wasn't it? But what if we need to authenticate with our server? And what if we want to send our message in a more secure manner?

## Authentication

You will quite often find that an [SMTP server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smtp_server) requires you to authenticate yourself before it will let you do anything. This is however very simple to do. All we need, is to provide our credentials to the client:

```csharp
var client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com")
{
    Credentials = new NetworkCredential
    {
        UserName = "me@example.com",
        Password = "password",
    },
};
```

Now, when you try to send your message like before, it should be sent without problems ðŸ™‚ But what if you want to send your email securely?

## Using SSL to encrypt the connection

To send emails through an encrypted connection, all you have to do is to set the [EnableSSL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.mail.smtpclient.enablessl.aspx) property of the SmtpClient to `true`:

```csharp
var client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com")
{
    EnableSSL = true,
    Credentials = new NetworkCredential
    {
        UserName = "me@example.com",
        Password = "password",
    },
};
```

When you now try to send your email, it will use the [Secure Socket Layer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) to encrypt the connection. Like me, you might run into a problem though; an [AuthenticationException](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.authentication.authenticationexception.aspx) with the following message: <cite>The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure.</cite>

## Imperfect certificates

After reading about [how these certificates work](https://www.symantec.com/page.jsp?id=how-ssl-works) and some more digging around I found out that the certificate of the SMTP server I use is considered invalid for two reasons: Firstly it was not issued by a trusted Certification Authority (like VeriSign or Thawte), but by my host ([Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?322827)) themselves. And finally there is a mismatch between the domain I'm connecting to (smtp.example.com) and the domain the certificate was issued to (mail.dreamhost.com).

## Manual certificate validation

SSL has two purposes: security and authentication. And the security will actually work fine and all the traffic will be encrypted even if the authentication fails. In other words, as long as we can look at the certificate ourselves and be sure that _we_ thrust it, we can go ahead and continue with our work.

To check the certificate ourselves we can provide a [RemoteCertificate&shy;ValidationCallback](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.security.remotecertificatevalidationcallback.aspx) delegate to a class called the [ServicePoint&shy;Manager](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.servicepointmanager.aspx).

```csharp
  ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = OurCertificateValidation;
```

But how can we decide if we should trust the certificate or not? Well, I have found three ways that works nicely. Well, actually just two since the first is just to cover your eyes and let anything pass...

### Pretend validation

The following implementation is a way to simply say that <cite>I don't care</cite>:

```csharp
static bool OurCertificateValidation(object s, X509Certificate certificate, X509Chain chain, SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors)
{
    return true;
}
```

This is of course not very good... we should at least make _some_ effort and check if the certificate is the one we should be getting. We can for example...

### Check the certificate fingerprint

Certificates have something called a fingerprint and if we know the fingerprint of the certificate we _should_ get, then we can compare it with the fingerprint of the one we actually got.

```csharp
static bool OurCertificateValidation(object s, X509Certificate certificate, X509Chain chain, SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors)
{
    return certificate.GetCertHashString()
        == "6B8C79AB966D70277BA86E6F820859A2B5B8CCC0"; // SHA-1 fingerprint
}
```

If you don't think this is enough, you can for example...

### Check the whole certificate

If you can export the certificate to a file somehow, you can then later compare the certificate you get with the one you have stored and make sure they are equal.

```csharp
static bool OurCertificateValidation(object s, X509Certificate certificate, X509Chain chain, SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors)
{
    var actualCertificate = X509Certificate.CreateFromCertFile("example.cert");
    return certificate.Equals(actualCertificate);
}
```

I got a hold of the certificate file by sticking the following snippet inside my validation delegate, ran my code once, and then changed it back to normal again:

```csharp
static bool OurCertificateValidation(object s, X509Certificate certificate, X509Chain chain, SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors)
{
    using (var file = File.Create("example.cert"))
    {
        var cert = certificate.Export(X509ContentType.Cert);
        file.Write(cert, 0, cert.Length);
    }
    return false;
}
```

I also successfully exported it from Opera, which I use as an email client, by going to Preferences, Security, Manage Certificates, Approved and then export the one I want. This of course assumes you have have previously approved the certificate for use with Opera.

## Wrap-up

That's all for now! Found it kind of fun to get this working and thought I could share it in case someone else struggles with this.

Here is my final, complete code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Mail;
using System.Net;
using System.Security.Authentication;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
using System.IO;
using System.Net.Security;

namespace Geekality.SecureEmail
{
    class Program
    {
        static bool OurCertificateValidation(object s, X509Certificate certificate, X509Chain chain, SslPolicyErrors sslPolicyErrors)
        {
            var actualCertificate = X509Certificate.CreateFromCertFile("example.com.cert");

            return certificate.Equals(actualCertificate);
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Register our own certificate validation
            ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback = OurCertificateValidation;

            // Message
            var from = new MailAddress("me@example.com", "Me");
            var to = new MailAddress("you@example.com", "Myself");

            var message = new MailMessage(from, to)
            {
                Subject = "Greetings!",
                Body = "How are you doing today?",
            };

            // Create client
            var client = new SmtpClient("smtp.example.com")
            {
                EnableSsl = true,
                Credentials = new NetworkCredential
                {
                    UserName = "me@example.com",
                    Password = "password",
                },
            };

            // Try to send
            using (client)
            {
                try
                {
                    client.Send(message);
                    Console.WriteLine("Message sent!");
                }
                catch (AuthenticationException e)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
                }
                catch (SmtpException e)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
                }
            }

            Console.ReadKey(true);
        }
    }

}
```
