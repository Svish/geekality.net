You can remove [administrative shares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_share) by running for example `net share c$ /delete`, however the shares will be recreated when you reboot. To fully disable them, delete them, stick the following in a new reg file (for example _disable_admin_shares.reg_) and run it. When you reboot now they shouldn't come back ðŸ™‚

```text
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\LanmanServer\Parameters]
"AutoShareWks"=dword:00000000
```

You can also do it manually by running regedit and setting that key yourself, but who wants that...
