Playing [Factorio](http://factorio.com) and loving it! But I'm playing rather slowly, so even though I like that the [enemies](https://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Enemies) are aggressive (didn't select the peaceful option), they have [evolved](https://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Enemies#Evolution) much further than I'm comfortable with compared to my ability to deal with them at the moment...

Found some [console commands](https://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Console) for resetting the [evolution factor](https://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Enemies#Spawn_chances_by_evolution_factor) (what gradually increases and makes the enemies more and more nasty), and for nuking already spawned enemies.

```lua
/c game.evolution_factor = 0
/c game.forces["enemy"].kill_all_units()
```

To see the current evolution factor:

```lua
/c game.local_player.print(game.evolution_factor)
```
