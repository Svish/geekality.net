Playing <a href="http://factorio.com">Factorio</a> and loving it! But I'm playing rather slowly, so even though I like that the <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Enemies">enemies</a> are aggressive (didn't select the peaceful option), they have <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Enemies#Evolution">evolved</a> much further than I'm comfortable with compared to my ability to deal with them at the moment...

Found some <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Console">console commands</a> for resetting the <a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Enemies#Spawn_chances_by_evolution_factor">evolution factor</a> (what gradually increases and makes the enemies more and more nasty), and for nuking already spawned enemies.

Check your keyboard settings for how to toggle the console.

```lua
/c game.evolution_factor = 0
/c game.forces["enemy"].kill_all_units()
```

To see the current evolution factor:

```lua
/c game.local_player.print(game.evolution_factor)
```
