Would you be able to say how much `167892598784` bytes are without spending quite some time thinking about it first? Large amounts of bytes are rarely very readable to people. Not for me anyways.

Just stumbled over a handy function to make that number of bytes a bit more readable for us humans. I found it in [a comment in the PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/function.disk-total-space.php) and figured I could note it down here so I don't lose it and in case someone else could need it. A function like that is just bound to come in handy some day...

Let me know if you have a better name for it, but here it is ðŸ™‚

<ins dateTime="2013-04-11T21:10:45+00:00">
  **Update 2013-04-11:** Added zero check (prevents crash if `$bytes` is zero)
  and abs call (prevents crash when `$bytes` is negative)
</ins>

```php
function make_pretty($bytes)
{
    $symbols = array('B', 'KiB', 'MiB', 'GiB', 'TiB', 'PiB', 'EiB', 'ZiB', 'YiB');

    if($bytes == 0)
        return sprintf('%.2f '.$symbols[0], 0);

    $exp = floor(log(abs($bytes)) / log(1024));

    return sprintf('%.2f '.$symbols[$exp], $bytes/pow(1024, floor($exp)));
}
```

## Usage example

```php
echo make_pretty(167892598784); //  156.36 GiB
echo make_pretty(719267016);    //  685.95 MiB
echo make_pretty(114893);       //  112.20 KiB
echo make_pretty(6218);         //  6.07 KiB
echo make_pretty(42);           //  42.00 B
echo make_pretty(0);            //  0.00 B
echo make_pretty(-50);          // -50.00 B
```

That was it for now ðŸ™‚
