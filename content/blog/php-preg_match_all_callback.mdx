There are several <a href="http://php.net/manual/ref.pcre.php"><abbr title="Regular Expressions (Perl-Compatible)">PCRE</abbr> functions</a> available, but today I looked for one that just wasn't there: `preg_match_all_callback()`.

Could've maybe used <a href="http://php.net/manual/function.preg-replace-callback.php">`preg_replace_callback()`</a>, but felt wrong since I didn't actually want to do any <em>replacing</em>. I just needed my function to be called for each match.

So I wrote it myself. Noting it here, in case I (or someone else) needs it again.

```php
<?php
/**
 * Perform a global regular expression match
 * and calls the callback for each match.
 */
function preg_match_all_callback(
        string $pattern,
        string $subject,
        callable $callback)
{
    $r = preg_match_all($pattern, $subject, $matches, PREG_SET_ORDER);
    foreach($matches ?? [] as $match)
        $callback($match);
    return $r;
}
```

And, in case someone reads this post and knows it actually <em>does</em> exist... and if that someone is you, please do leave a comment!

And, yes, I could've just written those 3 lines where I needed them, but what's the fun in that? And besides, the shorter the code where it counts, the easier what counts is to read.

## Usage

```php
preg_match_all_callback('/(\w)\w*/', 'Hello World', 'var_dump');
```

```
array (size=2)
  0 => string 'Hello' (length=5)
  1 => string 'H' (length=1)

array (size=2)
  0 => string 'World' (length=5)
  1 => string 'W' (length=1)
```
