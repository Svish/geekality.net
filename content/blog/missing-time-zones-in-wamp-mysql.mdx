If you try to run for example `SET time_zone = 'Europe/Oslo'` on the default MySQL database that comes with <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en">WAMP</a> you might get an error saying the time zone doesn't exist.

Apparently this is because the `time_zone` tables for some reason are empty.

### How to fix

1. Go to <b><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/timezones.html">dev.mysql.com/downloads/timezones.html</a></b>
2. Download the <b>POSIX standard Time zone description tables, version 2011n</b> zip archive
3. Extract the files and overwrite the ones in <b>`C:\wamp\bin\mysql\mysql5.6.17\data\mysql`</b>, or whatever your equivalent path would be
4. Restart MySQL

Setting the time zone should now work ðŸ™‚
