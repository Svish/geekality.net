Was going to test some code the other day which needed to talk to an SFTP server.
Stumbled over a small gem which was super simple to use. It's called [Core FTP mini-sftp-server](http://www.coreftp.com/server/).
No installation, no tricky stuff. Just download and run. Great stuff 🙂

📝 **Note:** They also have a not-mini-sftp-server, which is the
first dowload, so make sure to get the right download link.
