SourceTree comes with its own embedded Git and Mercurial. These are not available outside on regular command lines by default, but seems you can make them so by adding the following two paths to your `%PATH%` variable.

```text
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Atlassian\SourceTree\git_local\bin
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Atlassian\SourceTree\hg_local
```
