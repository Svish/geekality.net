This function will "stream" a file line-by-line, as a [`Generator`](http://php.net/manual/en/language.generators.php).

This can be very useful if you need to process a big file, line by line, without reading the whole thing into memory all at once.

```php
function read($file)
{
    $fp = fopen($file, 'rb');

    while(($line = fgets($fp)) !== false)
        yield rtrim($line, "\r\n");

    fclose($fp);
}
```

Usage:

```php
foreach(read('http://example.com') as $line)
{
    var_dump($line);
}
```
