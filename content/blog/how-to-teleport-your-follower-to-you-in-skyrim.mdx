Ever lost your follower in a cave? Ever had your follower gotten stuck on a ledge, behind some spider web or other ridiculous stuff? Here's how to teleport them to your current location.

## Find the reference id of your follower

1. Open the console by pressing <kbd>|</kbd>
2. Using the mouse, click on your follower to see his/her reference id.
3. Enter the following command using the reference id you got:

```text
prid a2c94
```

This will set the target of your teleportation.

## Do the teleport

1. Enter the following command to move your follower to your current location:

```text
moveto player
```
