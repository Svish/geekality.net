When writing C#, in Visual Studio, using generics... have you ever tried checking for null? I have always found that a bit of a hassle.

Say we have this method which returns the subject if it is not null, and the result of a `createNew()` function if it _is_ null.

```csharp
public static T NewIfNull<T>(this T subject, Func<T> createNew)
{
    if (subject == null)
        return createNew();
    return subject;
}
```

Not claiming this is a very useful method, but it was the simplest thing I could come up with ðŸ˜› Anyways, in Visual Studio you will now probably have a blue (is blue here at least) squiggly line under the [equality operator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/53k8ybth.aspx). It states you are doing a <cite>Possible compare of value type with 'null'</cite>, which of course is reasonable and correct. We _could_ just ignore it and move on... but we don't really like squiggly lines, do we? I sure don't... so lets get rid of it.

## Faulty solution

ReSharper suggests that I use [`default(T)`](<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xwth0h0d(VS.80).aspx>) instead of null, like this:

```csharp
public static T NewIfNull<T>(T subject, Func<T> createNew)
{
    if (subject == default(T))
        return createNew();
    return subject;
}
```

Now, this won't do at all. First of all, we don't really want to check for [default(T)](<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xwth0h0d(VS.80).aspx>), we want to check for null. And second of all, we now have a long red squiggly line under the whole equality statement! It says that it <cite>Cannot apply operator '==' to operands of type 'T' and 'T'</cite>. That messages doesn't really make much sense to me, to be honest, but I trust that it is true. Either way, we have to get rid of it.

## Good solution

[ReferenceEquals](<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.object.referenceequals(VS.80).aspx>) to the rescue! We can use that method, instead of the equality operator, and
compare with null like we intended! ðŸ˜„

```csharp
public static T NewIfNull<T>(T subject, Func<T> createNew)
{
    if (ReferenceEquals(subject, null))
        return createNew();
    return subject;
}
```

That is kind of ugly though... And it is _so_ much longer to type. _And_, most importantly, it kind of makes the code a bit unreadable... At least if you have a bunch of things you have to check for null, like I did today.

But fear not! Today I came up with a tiny, but brilliant extension method which makes things a lot better:

```csharp
public static bool IsNull<T>(this T subject)
{
    return ReferenceEquals(subject, null);
}

public static T NewIfNull<T>(T subject, Func<T> createNew)
{
    if (subject.IsNull())
    return createNew();
    return subject;
}
```

Doesn't that just look _a lot_ cleaner? I think so ðŸ˜„

And yes, I know this isn't really a big issue. And I realize you have probably all come up with something similar already. Yes, I am slow ðŸ˜› But hey, I figured it might be worth sharing this anyways, just in case you hadn't thought about it before. I sure hadn't! And I really do think that tiny snippet of code made a huge difference in code readability. And we all want that, don't we? Yes, yes we do...
