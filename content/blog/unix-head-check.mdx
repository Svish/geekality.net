Needed to check the `HEAD` of a URL on two Unix servers today. Goal was to check if routing, firewall and load balancer rules were all good. One server only had `curl`, and the other only had wget, so here are commands for both:

```bash
$ wget -S --spider http://geekality.net
$ curl -i -X HEAD http://geekality.net
```
