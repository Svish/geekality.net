Stumbled over another interesting blog post called the [Professionalism and the Four-Way Test](http://www.nspe.org/blogs/mentoring/archive/2011/01/31/professionalism-and-the-four-way-test.aspx). It consists of the following four questions:

1. Is it the truth?
1. Is it fair to all concerned?
1. Will it build goodwill and better friendships?
1. Will it be beneficial to all concerned?

Most definitely something to ask yourself and to reflect upon once in a while; both in your profession and in general life.
