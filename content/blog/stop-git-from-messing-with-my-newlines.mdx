I'm sorry, but I just <em>hate</em> when Git is messing with my files... That's just not its job!

## Local fix

To fix it on your computer, set `core.autocrlf` to ``false`.

```bash
# This shows what it's set to now, and where
> git config --show-origin core.autocrlf
```

Then either edit the file manually, or do one of the following:

```bash
# System level (might disappear with git upgrades?)
> git config --system core.autocrlf false

# User level (probably preferred)
> git config --global core.autocrlf false

# Repo level (no point, use .gitattributes instead)
> git config --local core.autocrlf false
```

## Shared repository fix

For shared projects, others might not have set this or even want to set this, so to prevent issues there, creating a `.gitattributes` file at the root of the repo with the following contents <em>should</em> fix things:

```text
* -text
```

## Renormalization

For already messed up repos or working-copies, after changing `core.autocrlf`, you might be able to renormalize the files one of the methods described in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53584041/39321">this answer on StackOverflow</a>.
