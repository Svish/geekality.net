Sometimes you want a batch file to _always_ run with the directory of the script as the working directory. Not whatever directory you ran it from.

```dos
@echo off
pushd %~dp0
do stuff
popd
```

Here `pushd` changes the directory to `%~dp0`, which is the directory of the running batch script. `popd` returns to whatever it was when the script started running. Not sure if the last step is necessary, but there you go anyways ðŸ™‚
