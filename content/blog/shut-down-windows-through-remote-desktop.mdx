Needed to gracefully shut down a Windows 7 virtual machine I was connected to through Remote Desktop today and found there was no Shut Down option in the start menu. Apparently by design, generally a good thing, and luckily easy enough to get around:

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>End</kbd>.
1. Use the shut down button there instead.
