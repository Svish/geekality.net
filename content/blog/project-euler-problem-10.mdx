## Solution

Using our [previously made](/?p=176) Eratosthenes class for generating primes, this problem can be solved in a very easy way.

```csharp
var answer = new Eratosthenes()
    .TakeWhile(x => x < 2000000)
    .Aggregate((sum, x) => sum + x)
```

And that was it actually. The only problem here is that it takes a bit of time. On my machine this solution takes over 2 seconds. Not very long maybe, but compared to the others that is quite a bit of time actually. Especially when I know that it _could_ go a lot faster if I just had a faster algorithm for generating prime numbers. However, I haven't found that yet. Actually, I have, but I haven't managed to implement any of them yet... ðŸ˜›

## Update October, 19th 2009

Managed to finally implement another algorithm called the [Sieve of Atkin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Atkin). I have written about it in [a different post](/?p=674).

Using that class, the solution to this problem looks like this:

```csharp
var answer = new Atkin(2000000)
    .Aggregate((sum, x) => sum + x);
```

Pretty similar. But! The solution now takes only about 160 milliseconds, instead of the original 2 seconds ðŸ˜„ Is that cool or what?
