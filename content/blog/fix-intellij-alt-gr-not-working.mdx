I've several times had the <kbd>Alt Gr</kbd> key stop working while using IntelliJ. On norwegian keyboards, this key is essential in typing e.g. the brackets \{\} and \[\], so it not working is extremely annoying. And what increases the annoyance even more, is that, when this happens, the key for some reason stops working in _other_ programs too.

Anyways, this seemed to fix it, on my machine at least, for now:

- Go to Help \ Edit Custom Properties
- Paste in this line: `actionSystem.force.alt.gr=true`
- Restart IntelliJ
