I like to use FireFox Developer Edition, and today I discovered that root certificates and such added to Windows (to trust self-signed certificates used with dev-servers, etc.) apparently are ignored by FireFox. At least by default:

1. Go to [about:config](about:config)
2. Find `security.enterprise_roots.enabled`
3. Set it to `true`
