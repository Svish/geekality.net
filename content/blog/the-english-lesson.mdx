A poem about English from [The Society for the Promotion of Good Grammar](http://grammatically.blogspot.com/2009/08/english-lesson.html).

> We'll begin with box, and the plural is boxes;  
> But the plural of ox should be oxen, not oxes.  
> Then one fowl is goose, but two are called geese  
> Yet the plural of moose should never be meese.
>
> You may find a lone mouse or a whole lot of mice,  
> But the plural of house is houses, not hice.  
> If the plural of man is always called men,  
> When couldn't the plural of pan be called pen?
>
> The cow in the plural may be cows or kine,  
> But the plural of vow is vows, not vine.  
> And I speak of a foot, and you show me your feet,  
> But I give a boot - would a pair be called beet?
>
> If one is a tooth and a whole set are teeth,  
> Why shouldn't the plural of booth be called beeth?  
> If the singular is this and plural is these,  
> Why shouldn't the plural of kiss be nicknamed kese?
>
> Then one may be that, and three may be those,  
> Yet the plural of hat would never be hose;  
> We speak of a brother, and also of brethren,  
> But though we say mother, we never say methren.
>
> The masculine pronouns are he, his and him,  
> But imagine the feminine she, shis, and shim!  
> So our English, I think you will all agree,  
> Is the trickiest language you ever did see.
>
> I take it you already know  
> Of tough and bough and cough and dough?  
> Others may stumble, but not you  
> On hiccough, thorough, slough, and through?
>
> Well done! And now you wish, perhaps  
> To learn of less familiar traps?  
> Beware of heard, a dreadful word  
> That looks like beard and sounds like bird.
>
> And dead; it's said like bed, not bead;  
> For goodness sake, don't call it deed!  
> Watch out for meat and great and threat,  
> (they rhyme with suite and straight and debt)
>
> A moth is not a moth in mother.  
> Nor both in bother, broth in brother.  
> And here is not a match for there.  
> And dear and fear for bear and pear.
>
> And then there's dose and rose and lose --  
> Just look them up -- and goose and choose.  
> And cork and work and card and ward,  
> And font and front and word and sword.
>
> And do and go, then thwart and cart.  
> Come, come, I've hardly made a start.
>
> A dreadful language? Man alive,  
> I'd learned to speak it when I was five,
>
> And yet to write it, the more I sigh,  
> I'll not learn how 'till the day I die.
