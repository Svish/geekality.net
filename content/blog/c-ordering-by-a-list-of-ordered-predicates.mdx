In a project at work we were going to merge a bunch of PDfs and Word documents into a single PDF. The ordering irrelevant except that certain files had to be before all the others. Solved it initially like this:

```csharp
var filesInOrder = GetFiles()
    .OrderByDescending(x => x.Filename.StartsWith("ProjectDescription_"))
    .ThenByDescending(x => x.Filename.StartsWith("Budget_"))
    .ThenByDescending(x => x.Filename.StartsWith("CV_"))
    .ToArray();
```

Found it a bit ugly though, and decided to ask [a question about other ways](http://stackoverflow.com/q/28855758/39321) on StackOverflow. Got several interesting answers and inspired by those and some further thinking I tried to make a generic solution myself, which I thought I could also blog here so I definitely know where to find it if I ever need it again...

### My solution

```csharp
public class OrderedPredicateComparer<T> : IComparer<T>
{
    private readonly Func<T, bool>[] ordinals;
    public OrderedPredicateComparer(IEnumerable<Func<T, bool>> predicates)
    {
        ordinals = predicates.ToArray();
    }

    public int Compare(T x, T y)
    {
        return GetOrdinal(x) - GetOrdinal(y);
    }

    private int GetOrdinal(T item)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < ordinals.Length; i++)
            if (ordinals[i](item))
                return i - ordinals.Length;
        return 0;
    }
}
```

One issue here might be that the predicates will be called several times per item, which could be bad if working on a huge list. Haven't really benchmarked it though so who knows. For smaller uses it shouldn't matter much either way.

The nice thing about it being an `IComparer` is that you could push this into both `OrderBy` and `ThenBy`, and also use it in for example ordered dictionaries, priority queues, etc, and since it uses a list of fully generic predicates you could order things by pretty much anything with a yes/no answer ðŸ™‚

### Usage

```csharp
var ordering = new Func<string, bool>[]
    {
        x => x.StartsWith("ProjectDescription_"),
        x => x.StartsWith("Budget_"),
        x => x.StartsWith("CV_"),
    };

var files = GetFiles()
    .OrderBy(x => x.Filename, new OrderedPredicatesComparer<string>(ordering))
    .ToArray();
```

To make the final code even cleaner the ordering could be encapsulated in a sublcass like following, which is what I did in my actual code too:

```csharp
public class MySpecificOrdering : OrderedPredicatesComparer<string>
{
    private static readonly Func<string, bool>[] order = new Func<string, bool>[]
        {
            x => x.StartsWith("ProjectDescription_"),
            x => x.StartsWith("Budget_"),
            x => x.StartsWith("CV_"),
        };

    public MySpecificOrdering() : base(order) {}
}

var files = GetFiles()
    .OrderBy(x => x.Filename, new MySpecificOrdering())
    .ToArray();
```
