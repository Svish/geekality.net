To completely disable hibernation on Windows, open up an [elevated command prompt](/?p=1139) and run the following command:

```dos
powercfg â€“h off
```

This will both disable hibernation completely and remove the enormous hiberfil.sys from your system.

To enable it again, simply run it again with ON instead of OFF.

```dos
powercfg â€“h on
```

Why disable it? If you never use it, the hiberfil.sys takes up a lot of necessary space. And if you happen to be on a slightly old unstable laptop where the hibernation often fails for weird reasons, it might be nice disable it so there's not even possible to enter it by accident ðŸ™‚
