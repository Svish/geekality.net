I love the file search (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd>) and quick navigate (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>) in Sublime Text. What can be annoying however is when these present you with library code in your project, files related to source control, binary files or minified files.

Since I keep forgetting how to clean that up, here's a note to self (and others) on how to clean that up. Easy peasy.

1. Save as project (if you haven't already)
1. Edit project file
1. Add `file_exclude_patterns` and/or `folder_exclude_patterns` to the `folders` section.

Below is an example from one of my current projects which excludes the git repo folder, a cache folder, minified files and some binary files.

```json
{
  "folders": [
    {
      "path": "/D/dev/www/some-website",
      "folder_exclude_patterns": [".git", ".cache"],
      "file_exclude_patterns": ["*.mp3", "*.ogg", "*.pdf", "*.min.*"]
    }
  ]
}
```
