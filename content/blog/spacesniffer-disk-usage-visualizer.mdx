Ever wondered what eats up your disk space? <a href="http://superuser.com/a/132932/62">Discovered</a> a nice simple tool which can answer that question. It's called <strong><a href="http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/">SpaceSniffer</a></strong> and it scans your disk (or a just folder if you want) and then creates a clean map of what takes up space.

One thing to note: I recommend you run it with Administrator privileges. If you don't, it won't be able to scan certain system folders and such.
