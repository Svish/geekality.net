Sometimes curious about this, usually because I forgot to note what time I arrived at the office, and I keep forgetting how to check. So, here's some commands I found on [SuperUser](https://superuser.com/q/523726/62) which seem to do the trick:

```dos
> systeminfo | find /i "Boot Time"
System Boot Time:          15.10.2021, 08:37:29
> wmic os get lastbootuptime
LastBootUpTime
20211015083729.500000+120
> net statistics workstation | find /i "Statistics since"
Statistics since 15.10.2021 08:37:45
```

Also discovered [this one](https://superuser.com/a/1350900/62), which will create a more thorough report, which can be interesting to look at:

```dos
> powercfg /sleepstudy /output report.html && start report.html
```
