Don't remember where or how I came over this font... Might have been a tweet linking to <a href="http://codeulate.com/2009/11/making-githubs-code-readable/">this post</a>... Either way, it's a very nice font I think. Sure looks a lot better than the default Eclipse font anyways :roll:

The font is called _Bitstream Vera Sans Mono_, and you can download it for free at <a href="http://www.dafont.com/bitstream-vera-mono.font">dafont.com/bitstream-vera-mono.font</a>. Go try it out!
