What I did to get from zero to a working (hopefully) secure GPG key set, usable for [signing](/?p=3086) and encrypting stuff on Windows...

1. Install [Gpg4win](https://www.gpg4win.org).
2. Create main/root key:

```bash
ðŸ”¶ $ gpg --gen-key

This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Please select what kind of key you want:
(1) RSA and RSA (default)
(2) DSA and Elgamal
(3) DSA (sign only)
(4) RSA (sign only)
ðŸ”¶ Your selection? 4
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
0 = key does not expire

<n> = key expires in n days
<n>w = key expires in n weeks
<n>m = key expires in n months
<n>y = key expires in n years
ðŸ”¶ Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
ðŸ”¶ Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

ðŸ”¶ Real name: Alice Person
ðŸ”¶ Email address: alice.person@example.com
ðŸ”¶ Comment: alice
You selected this USER-ID:
"Alice Person (alice) <alice.person@example.com>"

ðŸ”¶ Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
gpg: key AA79CCAE marked as ultimately trusted
public and secret key created and signed.

gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: public key of ultimately trusted key AA77EE54 not found
gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, PGP trust model
gpg: depth: 0 valid: 2 signed: 0 trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 2u

Key fingerprint = 98A1 5DD0 0653 55BB 3358 B35C 8C0B BECB AA79 CCAE
uid [ultimate] Alice Person (alice) <alice.person@example.com>

Note that this key cannot be used for encryption. You may want to use
the command "--edit-key" to generate a subkey for this purpose.
```

3. Open the key for editing:

```bash
ðŸ”¶ $ gpg --edit-key alice

4. (Optionally) Add other user ids, and set the right one as primary:

```bash

```

6. Save (and quit):

```bash
ðŸ”¶ gpg> save
```

7. Export keys for (safe!) storage:

```bash
ðŸ”¶ $ set id=AA79CCAE
ðŸ”¶ $ gpg -a --export %id% > %id%_public.asc
ðŸ”¶ $ gpg -a --export-secret-keys %id% > %id%_private.asc
ðŸ”¶ $ gpg -a --export-secret-subkeys %id% > %id%_subkeys.asc
```

8. Export revocation file:

```bash
ðŸ”¶ $ gpg -a --gen-revoke %id% > %id%_revoke_cert.asc

sec 4096R/AA79CCAE 2017-08-23 Alice Person (alice) <alice.person@example.com>

Create a revocation certificate for this key? (y/N) y
Please select the reason for the revocation:
0 = No reason specified
1 = Key has been compromised
2 = Key is superseded
3 = Key is no longer used
Q = Cancel
(Probably you want to select 1 here)
ðŸ”¶ Your decision? 1
Enter an optional description; end it with an empty line:
ðŸ”¶ >
Reason for revocation: Key has been compromised
(No description given)
ðŸ”¶ Is this okay? (y/N) y

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Alice Person (alice) <alice.person@example.com>"
4096-bit RSA key, ID AA79CCAE, created 2017-08-23

Revocation certificate created.

Please move it to a medium which you can hide away; if Mallory gets
access to this certificate he can use it to make your key unusable.
It is smart to print this certificate and store it away, just in case
your media become unreadable. But have some caution: The print system of
your machine might store the data and make it available to others!
