If you find yourself in the regular command line (`cmd.exe`) on Windows and you'd like to run a PowerShell script, you can do it like this:

```dos
powershell ./example-script.ps1
```

Would be nice if you could just run it directly as a bat file though, right? And yes, [you can](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6818266/39321)!

Simply open up an [elevated command prompt](/?p=1139) and then run the following commands:

```dos
setx PATHEXT "%PATHEXT%;.PS1" /m
assoc .ps1=Microsoft.PowerShellScript.1
ftype Microsoft.PowerShellScript.1="%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" "%1"
```

This tells Windows that files with the .ps1 file extension should be considered executable, that their file type should be `Microsoft.PowerShellScript.1` and that this file type should be sent as a parameter to the PowerShell executable.

You might want to check if there is something registered for this file type already before you do this. To do that simply run `assoc .ps1` and `ftype Microsoft.PowerShellScript.1`. For me the file type was already associated with ps1 files, but the handler was set to notepad for some reason.

Either way, after opening up a new command prompt (to make sure the new `PATHEXT` environment variable is loaded), you should be able to run PowerShell scripts directly just like `.bat` and `.exe` files:

```dos
example-script
```

Yey!

## ...ExecutionPolicy?

When trying to run your own scripts, you might also be blocked by a restricted execution policy. If so, open up a powershell console and run the following:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
