Not sure where twenty-ten went, but twenty-eleven is up next. So, happy new year
everyone! Take good care of yourself, your friends and your family. Remember to stop
and think once in a while. About what you're doing and where you're heading. And
remember to spend your time wisely, cause before you know it, it'll be twenty-thirteen
