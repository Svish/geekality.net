So, as my brother noticed in my last post, I have some cool equations here. The brilliance behind it is something called <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, which can be used in WordPress blogs thanks to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-latex/">WP LaTeX</a> plugin.

I am a total LaTeX newbie though, so I often struggle a bit with... getting it right. Trying it out by previewing WordPress posts is sloooow, so I decided to create myself a simple test-rig. A simple web page with a form and a button.
