Thought I'd make a list of my favorite podcasts, just for the fun of it. Not a long list at all, but definitely a list of my favorites. And I mean, really favorites. Check them out if you haven't. I love to listen to these on the bus to/from work ðŸ™‚

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/no/podcast/this-developers-life/id389727545">
      This Developer's Life
    </a>
    <br />
    Great talks and stories from the lives of developers.

      Stuff you should know
    </a>
    <br />
    Awesome podcast where they take up rather random subjects which are usually
    a lot more fascinating than you think ðŸ˜›

</ul>

That's it for now. Will add more later probably. In the mean time, what's your favorite podcast? Please share in the comments below!
