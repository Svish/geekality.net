I earlier wrote about the book, [The Art of Unit Testing](http://www.geekality.net/2009/11/03/the-art-of-unit-testing/)
, which I finished a while ago. That book was very good and was focused on how to
write good unit tests. It also mentioned [Test-Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development),
TDD, but not too much. The book I read next, which I finished a few days ago, was
kind of the other way around. Pretty much only about TDD. And from the title, _Test-Driven
Development: By Example_, that shouldn't be much of a shocker ðŸ˜›

<hr className="fix" />

The book is written by [Kent Beck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) and explains the basics about TDD. It does this pretty well, step by step, by example, just like the title says. The book also talks some about TDD in a more general sense. What it is, how it works, why it works, et cetera.

From the back-cover:

<blockquote>
  Readers will learn to:{' '}
  <ul>
    <li>
      Solve complicated tasks, beginning with the simple and proceeding to the
      more complex.
    </li>
    <li>Write automated tests before coding.</li>
    <li>
      Grow a design organically by refactoring to add design decisions one at a
      time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create tests for more complicated logic, including reflection and
      exceptions.
    </li>
    <li>Use patterns to decide what tests to write.</li>
    <li>
      Create tests using xUnit, the architecture at the heart of many
      programmer-oriented testing tools.
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

It pretty much kept the promises ðŸ™‚ The only part I didn't really like about this book was that I found much of the coding kind of messy. Could be because the languages used in the examples are Java and Python, which I don't really like that much syntax-wise. An even more important reason though, is that I just finished reading The Art of Unit Testing ðŸ˜› So, I suppose I have become a bit demanding when it comes to cleanliness when coding and writing unit-tests. I suppose that is a good thing ðŸ˜„ (I do however not claim in any way that the code I currently write is extremely clean in any way! But I do strive for it to be so ðŸ˜‰ )

I can really recommend this book to anyone who are curious to get familiar with TDD. I certainly see the value of doing TDD and is in the process of trying to incorporate it into my development habits.

<blockquote><ol>
	<li>Red -- Write a little test that doesn't work, and perhaps doesn't even compile at first.</li>
	<li>Green -- Make the test work quicky, committing whatever sins necessary in the process.</li>
	<li>Refactor -- Eliminate all of the duplication created in merely getting the test to work.</li>
</ol>

Red/green/refactor -- the TDD mantra.</blockquote>

You can get it at [Amazon](http://amzn.to/9kDFbg), and probably a lot of other places too as it is a pretty well-known book.
