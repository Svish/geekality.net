Areas in an ASP.NET MVC web application doesn't use the layout of your web application by default. The reason (as far as I understand) is that your <b>\_ViewStart.cshtml</b> which is usually located in <b>~/Views/</b> is only visible by views in that folder and its sub-folders.

So the solution, turns out, was more or less just to move that file up a level.

<ol>
<li>Move <b>~/Views/_ViewStart.cshtml</b> to <b>~/_ViewStart.cshtml</b>.
<li>Cut or copy the following elements from <b>~/Views/Web.config</b> and merge them into <b>~/Web.config</b>. I say merge, because configSections for example probably already exists, so put the sectionGroup inside it. Don't know if the Web.config handles multiple configSections...
```xml
  <configSections>
    <sectionGroup name="system.web.webPages.razor" ...>
      ...
    </sectionGroup>
  </configSections>

  <system.web.webPages.razor>
    ...
  </system.web.webPages.razor>
```
</ol>

All areas should now use the the same layout as the rest of your application.
