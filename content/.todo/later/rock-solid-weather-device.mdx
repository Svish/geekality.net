Just thought I could share this brilliant weather device. I would think it's highly accurate as well! Probably depends on where you install it though...

<hr className="fix" />

It's in Norwegian though, so stuck a translation below the picture ðŸ™‚

### English translation

Meteorological stone
Hot stone = Sun
Wet stone = Rain
White stone = Snow
No stone = Fog
