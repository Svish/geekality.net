If you run the following command on a Unix system, depending on your permissions and other stuff, you might see a lot of errors.

```bash
$ find / -name "tar"
```

In my case I got 8 regular findings and 63 lines of "find: cannot read dir /foo: Permission denied". Quite a lot of noise I really don't care about. Using my new knowledge about streams it is easy to get rid of all that though. Just pipe stderr into `/dev/null`.

```bash
$ find / -name "tar" 2>/dev/null
```

Voila. Clean output.

<Note>
  âš  Remember that when you do this _all_ errors will be sent to nowhere. So if
  there were any _other_ errors, they would also be gone. In this case I don't
  care, but in other instances you might want to do something else. For example
  direct it to a log file rather than to oblivion.

## Alternative

If you do care about other error messages, you could do as suggested by Richard in the comments: Redirect `stderr` to `stdout` and then use `grep` to filter out what you don't want to see.

```bash
$ find / -name "tar" 2>&1 | grep -v "Permission denied"
```
