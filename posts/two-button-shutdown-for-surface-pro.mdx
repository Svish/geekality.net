Just had severe issues getting my Surface Pro 3 to boot into windows. It got stuck on the Surface splash and didn't budge from there. Tried forcing it to shut down by holding down the power-button and restarting, but didn't help. What did help was to do a two button shutdown, which I didn't realize was a thing...

1. Press and hold the power button for 30 seconds.
1. Press and hold the volume up button and the power button for at least 15 seconds.
1. Wait 10 seconds
1. Press the power button normally, and hope it boots properly this time...

Step 2 seems to be the key, and ignore any sort of screen flashes or such while you hold the buttons down.

Also, by the way, if you simply hold the volume up button down and press the power button normally, you will get a boot menu, which I also didn't know about until today...
