Keep forgetting the names of packages I like to install when setting up Sublime Text 2. Or that I should install them to begin with. So here's a note to self on packages I should install whenever I reinstall this fantastic editor. And a note to you if you use the editor and didn't know such helpful packages existed.

- [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation)  
  The package that adds a package manager to the editor. After that is installed, simply press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>, bring up Install Package by typing "ip", and hit enter. You can then search for packages and install them super easy.
- [File Rename](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/File%20Rename)  
  Keyboard only renaming of files from within ST.
- [Highlight](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Highlight)  
  For copying syntax highlighted code either as HTML or as RTF. Nice for pasting code into emails, documents, etc.
- [Indent XML](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Indent%20XML)  
  For... indenting XML. Been very helpful for cleaning up messy SOAP requests from logs, etc.
- [LESS](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/LESS)  
  For syntax highlighting of LESS files
- [Markdown Preview](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Markdown%20Preview)  
  For quick preview of markdown files in the browser
- [Text Pastry](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Text%20Pastry)  
  For fun pasting madness. You can for example paste in sequences of numbers. E.g. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>n</kbd> and then `i20`, will paste integers starting at 20 in all your cursors.
