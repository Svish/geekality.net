Just watched a good video with Dr. Neil Nedley. Thought I could share ðŸ™‚ Among other things, he is talking about stress and handling stress. Some very interesting stuff in there and I really recommend that you watch it.

Below are some random quotes and notes from it that I've written down. Hopefully will remember them better by doing so and if I don't, at least I know where to look ðŸ˜› In addition, I hope that you will learn something new as well, and perhaps even poke your curiosity enough to watch it ðŸ˜‰

- Stress is not the big bad thing everybody thinks it is -- in fact, most acute stressors boost the immune system. Only when the stress is unusually prolonged or repetitive it becomes a potential threat to health. One exception is the body's reaction to acute stressors to which there is no way of responding except to passively endure. These types of stressors, which people might describe by using the phrase "my heart stopped beating", have a rapid and strong suppressive effect on some aspects of immune function.
- Active stress that can be responded to improves the immune system. Piling on of active stressors so that sleep, exercise, or the devotional life suffers will eventually impair the immune system.
- The serenity prayer: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
- Ambivalent beliefs: Beliefs that a person believes just strongly enough to feel bad about not acting on them, but not strongly enough to act on them.
- If you find yourself having ambivalent beliefs, you should have a look at them. And you should probably either start acting upon them, or stop believing in them.
- Sleep is worth far more before than after midnight. Two hours' good sleep before twelve oÂ´clock is worth more than four hours after twelve oÂ´clock.
- Physicians should teach that by studying after nine oÂ´clock, there is nothing gained, but much lost. Teach and practice that the time can be systematically employed, one duty after another attended to promptly, not allowed to lag, so that midnight hours will not have to be employed in laborious studies.
- Most often the late night studiers are studying because they haven't been organized and efficient throughout the day.
- The faster you walk, the longer you live. Particularly its noticed after age 70; how fast a 70 year old walks is directly related to how long they are going to live.
- Doing good to others, will actually improve our own immune system and ability to handle stress.
- 85% of worries don't have the bad outcome that the worrier had feared. Even when the bad outcome arrived, 79% said they handled it better than they thought they would.
- Whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. ([Philippians 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%204:8&version=NJV))
- We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed. ([2 Corinthians 4:8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204:8-9&version=NKJV))
