I often get truly tired of all the null checking when programming. I keep asking myself, is this really necessary? For example, I am the one coding it, and I am the only one who will be sending stuff into those methods. This is of course not always the case, but very often it is.

Anyways, I found some good advice on when we should check for null values and thought I could note it down here and share it.

>   want to make it very clear. Otherwise I don't mind getting the null
>   reference exception since that is also fairly clear what is going on.

Very good advice ðŸ™‚
