Trying to set up Apache on a server, something is hogging port 80, but very "helpfully" the Resource Monitor just reports "System" with PID 4... _not_ helpful.

However, some commands I found in [a StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26653919/39321) and its comments _were_ helpful:

```dos
netsh http show urlacl
netsh http show servicestate
net stop http
```

<Note>
  üìù Do _not_ just run these commands blindly and turn off services (in
  particular you should probably answer `N` when the last one asks...), but use
  them to identify what service(s) might be to blame. Then do an intelligent
  decision on whether the service is needed or not, before you potentially stop
  it and disable it...
