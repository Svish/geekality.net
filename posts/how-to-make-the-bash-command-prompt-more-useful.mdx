Was on a Linux box today and I found the command prompt rather useless. It looked like this:

```bash
-bash-3.2$
```

I know I'm using bash, and I don't really care about the version. Or that I'm using bash actually... But anyways, to make it more useful you can run this:

```bash
PS1="\u@\h:\w$ "
```

You will then get a prompt which contains your username, hostname and current working directory. _Much_ more useful in my opinion. If you have a different opinion, please share ðŸ™‚

You can find more stuff to put in your prompt by reading the prompting section of the [bash man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash).
