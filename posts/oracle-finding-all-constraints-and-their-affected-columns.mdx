Found [an SQL script](https://blog.mclaughlinsoftware.com/2009/03/05/validating-foreign-keys/) to list all constraints in an Oracle database together with affected columns. Putting it here in case I need it again... Took a while to run, but sure beats having to look through all the table definitions to find what exactly is preventing me from deleting a row...

```sql
SELECT UC.OWNER
,      UC.CONSTRAINT_NAME
,      UCC1.TABLE_NAME||'.'||UCC1.COLUMN_NAME "CONSTRAINT_SOURCE"
,      'REFERENCES'
,      UCC2.TABLE_NAME||'.'||UCC2.COLUMN_NAME "REFERENCES_COLUMN"
FROM USER_CONSTRAINTS uc
,    USER_CONS_COLUMNS ucc1
,    USER_CONS_COLUMNS ucc2
WHERE UC.CONSTRAINT_NAME = UCC1.CONSTRAINT_NAME
  AND UC.R_CONSTRAINT_NAME = UCC2.CONSTRAINT_NAME
  AND UCC1.POSITION = UCC2.POSITION -- Correction for multiple column primary keys.
  AND UC.CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'R'
ORDER BY UCC1.TABLE_NAME
,        UC.CONSTRAINT_NAME;
```

If you're just looking for one particular constraint you can of course also add `and UC.CONSTRAINT_NAME = 'SOME NAME'` ðŸ™‚
