Probably an obscure issue I'll never experience again, but in case it does, I found a solution in a [thread on Yahoo Answers](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110526051510AAfMa9H) that worked.

Run one of the commands below in a Command Prompt or just stick it into the Run dialog (<kbd>win</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd>). Then restart Skype \*sigh\*... 🙄

## Windows XP

```dos
> del "%userprofile%\Application Data\Skype\shared.xml"
```

### Windows 7 (and Vista?)

```dos
> del "%appdata%\Skype\shared.xml"
```

<Note>
  📝 You may of course also find and delete the file by using Windows Explorer.
  I just prefer a quick one-off command. 🙂
