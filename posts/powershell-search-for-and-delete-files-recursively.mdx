Short and simple, but keep forgetting some minor details, so... _note to self_...

```powershell
# Files
gci -recurse -force |
where {$_.name -eq "Thumbs.db"} |
foreach {ri $_.fullname -whatif}

# Directories (and using regex for matching)
gci -recurse -force |
where {$_.name -match "^(bin|obj)$"} |
foreach {ri $\_.fullname -recurse -whatif}
```

Minus the `-whatif`, of course ðŸ™‚
