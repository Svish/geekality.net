As usual, keep having to google this, so finally writing it down here...

## Last commit

Simply do `git reset HEAD~` and make new commits as needed.

## Commit further back

1. Perform an interactive rebase (e.g. `git rebase -i main`), and change the commit from `pick` to `edit`.
2. Reset the commit with `git reset HEAD~`.
3. Make new commits as needed.
4. Complete the rebase with `git rebase --continue`
