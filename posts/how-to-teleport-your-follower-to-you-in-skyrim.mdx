Ever lost your follower in a cave? Ever had your follower gotten stuck on a ledge, behind some spider web or other ridiculous stuff? Here's how to teleport them to your current location.

## Find the reference id of your follower

1. Open the console by pressing <kbd>|</kbd>
2. Using the mouse, click on your follower to see his/her reference id.
3. Enter the following command using the reference id you got:

```text
prid a2c94
```

This will set the target of your teleportation.

<Note>
  üìù Finding the id of your follower is of course best done _before_ you lose
  them. If you didn't, you can potentially also find their id in a wiki. For
  example, [here's a page for Lydia](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lydia),
  where you'll find the `RefID` being `000A2C94`, which stripped of prefix zeros
  is the same as what we got from clicking on her.
</Note>

## Do the teleport

4. Enter the following command to move your follower to your current location:

```text
moveto player
```
