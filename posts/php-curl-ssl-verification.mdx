While trying to figure out of [PayPal Payment Data Transfers](/?p=1210) I came over an issue that caused my [cURL](https://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) requests to fail.

These were the [cURL options](https://php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php) I used:

```php
curl_setopt_array($request, array
(
    CURLOPT_URL => 'https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr',
    CURLOPT_POST => TRUE,
    CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => http_build_query(array
    (
        'cmd' => '_notify-synch',
        'tx' => $tx,
        'at' => $your_pdt_identity_token,
    )),
    CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => TRUE,
    CURLOPT_HEADER => FALSE
));
```

Worked great on my web host, but locally didn't get any response. Turned out I was getting an error, <b>SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate</b>, and here are two ways to fix it.

### Globally via `php.ini`

1. Go to [curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html)
2. Download the [`cacert.pem`](https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem) and put it somwhere, for example `C:\wamp\cacert.pem`
3. Edit the curl.cainfo property in the curl section:

```ini
[curl]
; A default value for the CURLOPT_CAINFO option. This is required to be an
; absolute path.
curl.cainfo = C:\wamp\cacert.pem
```

4. Restart the web server

### Locally via `curl` option

1. Go to [curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html)
2. Download the [cacert.pem](https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem) and put it for example next to your script.
3. Set the `CURLTOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` and CURLOPT_CAINFO options when you're executing a curl request

```php
curl_setopt_array($request, array
(
    // Other options...
    CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => TRUE, // Verify peers
    CURLOPT_CAINFO => 'cacert.pem' // Path to file with certificates
));
```

## Why?

Since we are using the [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Https) protocol we need to somehow verify the one we are talking to. Your browser does this by checking their certificate against several built-in certificate stores from trusted certificate suppliers, like for example VeriSign.

cURL does this verification automatically as well, except on my local machine PHP wasn't configured with a default store to use.

Solution was as you can read above, to find one, and let PHP know about it, either through php.ini or through curl options.

Voila!
