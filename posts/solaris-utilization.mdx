Commands for checking various utilization on Solaris. Notes to self, based on [this](http://dennis_caparas.tripod.com/Configuring_sar_for_your_system.html), [this](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-unix-perfmonsar.html), [this](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1451/spmonitor-8.html), and [this](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-command-to-find-cpu-utilization/). The sar command depends on regular collection of data by sa1 and sa2 commands. See bottom of post for how to set that up.

- `top` (various)
- `vmstat` (various)
- `mpstat` (per CPU)
- `sar` (see below)

## Sar switches

```text
-u  CPU utilization
-a  File access
-d  Disk activity
-b  Buffer activity
-c  System call statistics
-g  Page-out and memory
-r  Unused memory
-k  Kernel memory allocation
-m  Interprocess communication
-p  Page-in activity
-q  Queue activity
-v  System table activity
-w  Swapping activity
-y  Terminal activity
-A  Overall system performance
```

For what output means, see [this page](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/821-1451/spmonitor-8.html).

## Real-time gathering

You can add interval and count to the `vmstat`, `sar` and `mpstat` commands to collect statistics real-time. For example

```bash
# Collect CPU usage in 10 second intervals, 60 times
$ sar -u 10 60
# Collect CPU usage in 10 second intervals indefinitely
$ sar -u 10
```

## Setup of `sar`

Some sar commands depends on sa1 and sa2 collecting data regularly. If not setup, you'll get the following error when running various `sar` commands (XX=todays date).

```bash
$ sar
sar: can\'t open /var/adm/sa/saXX
```

To set it up you need to edit the crontab of the sys user.

```bash
$ su
♯ su sys
♯ EDITOR=vi
♯ export EDITOR
♯ crontab -e
```

The sys crontab should already contain samples which you could just uncomment.

```bash
# System performance snapshot every hour
0 * * * 0-6 /usr/lib/sa/sa1
# System performance snapshot every 20 minutes, Monday through Friday between 8 and 17
20,40 8-17 * * 1-5 /usr/lib/sa/sa1
# ASCII report at 6:05, Monday through Friday
5 18 * * 1-5 /usr/lib/sa/sa2 -s 8:00 -e 18:01 -i 1200 -A
```

Following is a more straight forward version.

```bash
# System performance snapshot every 15 minutes
0,15,30,45 * * * 0-6 /usr/lib/sa/sa1
# ASCII report every day at 23:55
55 23 * * 0-6 /usr/lib/sa/sa2 -A
```

After editing, save the file and data should start being collected.
