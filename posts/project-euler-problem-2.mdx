Alright, next Project Euler problem:

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
>
> ```text
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
> ```
>
> Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not exceed four million.

## Solution

I pretty soon decided I wanted to solve these problems in a good way, and also to sort of try to build up a collection of useful tools that I could hopefully use when solving later Euler problems as well. And even if I didn't find any use for them later, at least I would have gotten some practice when making them ðŸ˜›

So, the first thing I figured I needed, was a source of Fibonacci numbers. So I created an interface for it, and an implementation (in case I wanted to swap out the implementation more easily later).

```csharp
public interface IFibonacciSequence : IEnumerable<ulong> {}

public class FibonacciSequence : IFibonacciSequence
{
    #region IFibonacciSequence Members
    public IEnumerator<ulong> GetEnumerator()
    {
        var a = 0UL;
        var b = 1UL;
        var c = a + b;

        while (true)
        {
            yield return c;

            c = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = c;
        }
    }


    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()
    {
        return GetEnumerator();
    }
    #endregion
}
```

After having created that class, solving the problem was pretty straight forward with a simple LINQ statement. I simple start taking numbers from the generator, filtering out the ones that are not even, up till I reach the highest number, and then I sum all of those up.

```csharp
var answer = new FibonacciSequence()
    .Where(x => x%2 == 0)
    .TakeWhile(x => x < 4000000)
    .Aggregate((sum, x) => sum + x);
```

Voila ðŸ™‚ The reason why I don't use the `Sum` method is that there doesn't seem to be one for `ulong`, only for `long`. And I decided that I for the first time would try to use `long` instead of `int` since the answer to some of these problems seems to be quite large. And to use `ulong` here since there aren't really any need for negative numbers...

Anyways, that was my solution to this problem. According to my test results, it takes less than 5 ms to find it, which is fast enough to me.

So, what do you think? How did you do it?
