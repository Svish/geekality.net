Keep forgetting how to do this, so here it is. How to do a quick and simple, recursive search for text using `grep`. Hint: It's very simple.

```bash
$ grep -rl "some text" .
```

That's all there is to it! `grep` is the command, `r` makes the search recursive (i.e. in the target folder and all its sub-folders), `l` means it will list the name of all the files where it finds the text, `"some text"` is the string to search for, and finally, the dot at the end means to start the search in the current directory. And just to clarify, this searches for text _inside_ of files, in the content of the files; not the filenames.

There, now I know where to find it when I forget it next time. And perhaps I have helped someone else too ðŸ™‚

Good night!
