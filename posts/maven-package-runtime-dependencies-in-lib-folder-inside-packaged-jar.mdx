When running `mvn package`, here's how to end up with a lib folder inside the resulting jar file which contains all the runtime dependencies of your project. Just add the following to your pom.xml.

```xml
<build>
<plugins>
    <plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.8</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
        <id>copy-dependencies</id>
        <phase>prepare-package</phase>
        <goals>
            <goal>copy-dependencies</goal>
        </goals>
        <configuration>
            <outputDirectory>
              ${project.build.directory}/classes/lib
            </outputDirectory>
            <includeScope>runtime</includeScope>
        </configuration>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
</build>
```

Works on my machine anyways. When I now open up the packaged jar archive I find a lib folder containing all jar dependencies, with the exception of those belonging to the scopes test and provided. Which is what I wanted. Score!!
