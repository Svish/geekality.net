Tried to find out how to convert windows-1252 code files to utf-8 without messing up Norwegian characters today. Couldn't really find anything good other than linux tools and php stuff. Finally, _\*facepalm\*_, I remembered it might be possible using Notepad... And sure enough, seems to work great. Just open up the windows-1252 encoded file in Notepad, then choose "Save as" and set encoding to UTF-8.

Hopefully I won't forget this the next time I need it... _\*sigh\*_
