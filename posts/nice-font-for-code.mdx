Don't remember where or how I came over this font... Might have been a tweet linking to [this post](https://codeulate.com/2009/11/making-githubs-code-readable/)... Either way, it's a very nice font I think. Sure looks a lot better than the default Eclipse font anyways :roll:

The font is called _Bitstream Vera Sans Mono_, and you can download it for free at [dafont.com/bitstream-vera-mono.font](https://www.dafont.com/bitstream-vera-mono.font). Go try it out!
