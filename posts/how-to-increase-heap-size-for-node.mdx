Experienced getting fatal build errors on our build server during ESLint linting of our React project:

> FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory

The MB values looked _very_ suspicious in that they were on either side of 2048 MB (2 GB), so suspected our project had run into some sort of limit. And seems there is indeed a max limit of ~2 GB by default on the heap size.

To increase the node heap size limit, set the `--max-old-space-size` to something more than 2048, e.g. like this on Windows:

```dos
setx NODE_OPTIONS "--max-old-space-size=4096" /m
```

To verify that it actually works (or check what it is by default), this command seems to do it:

```dos
node -e "console.log(require('v8').getHeapStatistics().total_available_size / 1024 / 1024)"
```

Note that the output for some reason always seem to be a bit more than what's set as the limit. Not sure what that's about, but anyways... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
