Tried to make a helpful batch script for something at work and learned some new things I thought I'd write down here so I know where to find it later.

## Turn off echoing

Should be known by everyone really, but in case you don't. Prevents the commands in the batch script and the command prompt to show up while the script is running. Beginning a line with @ does this for a single command.

```dos
@echo off
```

## Comments

```dos
REM A comment
REM Will still appear as a command if you haven't disabled echoing
```

## Labels and goto

Trivial, but I keep forgetting about this since I never use it in other programming.

```dos
goto end
REM Will be skipped
:end
```

## Set title of command prompt

```dos
title MyScript: Doing x now
```

## Check command line arguments

```dos
if "%~1"=="" (echo Usage: test.bat path && goto end)
if not exist %~1 (echo %~1 does not exist && goto end)
```

## Simpe choices

```dos
choice /c ny /n /d y /t 10 /m "Do you really want to do this? [y=10s,n]
if ERRORLEVEL 2 (
    echo Ok, I'll do it
)
```

## Run other batch scripts

If you don't use the call command, the other script will actually take over and your script will end.

```dos
call other.bat arg1 arg2 ...
```

## Do the same thing with various subjects

```dos
for %%x in ( a b c ) do ( echo %%x )
```
