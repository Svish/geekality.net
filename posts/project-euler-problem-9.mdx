## Solution

This I wasn't quite sure how to solve effectively and my solution is probably not the fastest or most clever, but at least it is pretty simple ðŸ™‚ To start off, we need a source of Pythagorean triplets.

```csharp
public class PythagoreanTriples
    : IEnumerable<Triple<ulong, ulong, ulong>>
{
  public IEnumerator<Triple<ulong, ulong, ulong>> GetEnumerator()
  {
      for (ulong c = 1;; c++)
          for (ulong b = 1; b <= c; b++)
              for (ulong a = 1; a < b; a++)
                  if ((a*a) + (b*b) == c*c)
                      yield return Tuple.From(a, b, c);
  }

  IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator()
  {
      return GetEnumerator();
  }
}
```

You can find the [`Triple`](https://abdullin.com/journal/2008/9/30/using-tuples-in-c-functions-and-dictionaries.html) class in a library called the [Lokad Shared Libraries](https://abdullin.com/shared-libraries/).

Anyways, that's pretty much what we need to solve this problem actually. We can use it like so:

```csharp
var t = new PythagoreanTriples()
  .First(x => x.Item1 + x.Item2 + x.Item3 == 1000);
var answer = t.Item1 * t.Item2 * t.Item3;
```

This piece of code simply goes through triplets until it finds the first one fulfilling our requirement. It runs in around 230 milliseconds, which is acceptable enough.

Do you have a more clever way to do this? Please leave a comment and share ðŸ™‚
