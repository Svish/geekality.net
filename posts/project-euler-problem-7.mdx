## Solution

This will be a very quick one, thanks to [the prime number generator](/?p=626) created earlier for [problem 3](/?p=176). All we need is actually this one line of code:

```csharp
var answer = new Eratosthenes().Take(10001).Last();
```

And that's it. It takes around 50 milliseconds, which is totally acceptable I would say. It can be sped up quite a bit though if we find a more efficient prime number generator. This, however, I will try to do in a later problem.
